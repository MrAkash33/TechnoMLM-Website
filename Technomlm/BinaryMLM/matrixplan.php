                    <h4>HOW DOES MATRIX MLM PLAN WORK?</h4>
                    <p>Matrix compensation plan requires each member to recruit and sponsor two other members to join the plan, that can potentially lead to a fast expansion of the network in a relatively less amount of time.</p>
                    <p>In the front line of the Matrix network marketing plan, there will be two legs, Left and Right. However, if a recruiter hires more than two members, the new member will be added to the next available member in the power leg. This allows a new member to be shared between all downline's power leg, nevertheless of who recruited them. This process is known as spillover. But in the case of profit leg, there will be no spillover because profit leg will only grow with the individually sponsored downlines.</p>
                    <p>One of the main variations of Matrix Technique is that it is quantity inspired in contrast to level inspired. This also indicates there is an inspiration to help new affiliates in your organization.</p>
