                            <p>Board plan MLM is also known as Revolving Matrix Plan and it is suitable for a limited number of people. As the name suggests, a board constitutes the centerpiece in this plan. It has a few members on it depending on the type of board plan in usage. The commonly adopted board plan is 2x2 board plan where in each member has to recruit two other people. This continues till all the positions in the board is filled. When the number of members exceeds the limit of the board, it is split into two sub-boards and the top member is promoted to the higher level. This keeps repeating every time a board reaches the maximum allowed members.</p>

                    <h4>HOW DOES MLM BOARD PLAN/MATRIX CYCLE PLAN WORK?</h4>
                    <p>Once you join this Plan, a blank board will be allotted and is required to fill a few columns in coordination to the entry of your associates. The dimension of columns may differ with respect to companies. The commission is rewarded with the completion of columns with the associates.</p>
                    <p>In board-plan, sponsorships are limited to two member legs on your first level and your downline is also restricted to two level depth,that is, this plan allows you to sponsor two members on the first level and four on the second level. In total, provides a full or completed Matrix Cycle of 6 people. Usually, MLM organizations collect a one-time joining fee from every distributor, which in the case of Matrix Cycle Plan is a commission. But, at the time of completion of the matrix cycle by the allocation of 6 members in the network, Board-plan MLM companies usually pay out a compensation of two times that of joining fee.The admin panel has the authority to set the commissions, like 100$.</p>
                    <P>For example : 2 members on your first level (1, 2)+ 4 members on your second level (3,4,5,6) = 6 members in your matrix= 1 CYCLE = $100</P>
                    <p>Once the matrix is completed consisting of 6 people are filled, Position (1) is permanently removed from that Board. Then, the remaining 6 position and splits them into 2 new boards. Position 2 and Position 3 are now both 1 on 2 new boards. The matrix is always filling left to right (3,4,5,6) also always follow sponsor board. This Process is repeated. the remaining 3, 4, 5, 6, Positions create 2 New Boards.</p>
